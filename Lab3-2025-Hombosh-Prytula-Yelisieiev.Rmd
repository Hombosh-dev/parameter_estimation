# Part I: Parameter Estimation

Aim: In problems 1 and 2, you will have to verify that the interval estimates produced by the known rules indeed
contain the parameter with probability equal to the confidence level.

## Problem 1

The expected value of the exponential distribution E (λ) is 1/λ, so that a good point estimate of
the parameter θ := 1/λ is the sample mean x. Confidence interval for θ can be formed in several different ways:

## Problem 2



# Part II: Unbiasedness of Estimators

## Problem 3



# Conclusion
